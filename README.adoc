[.lead]
SourceCode Dashboard Portal is an Organisational and group dashboard organizing status and documentation from GitHub repositories. It is designed for small to medium sized organizations (<2500 commits/hour). If you need support for higher commit-volumes
please contact the authors and we'll help you configure the system to your volumes/needs.

Key features:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Grouping features
** Quick overview of status for systems consisting of multiple codebases
** Browse commitslogs for systems consisting of several codebases
** See the status of all the codebases in a group
** Easy access to all documentation in one place
* Organization features
** Quick overview of status for all codebases in an organization
** Browse commitslogs for and latest changes for an entire organization
** See the status of all the groups in an organization
** Easy access to all documentation in one place

=== Getting started (running as SourceCode Dashboard Portal docker image)

[source,bash]
-----------------
# Start SCP dockerimage with oauth2 client credentials at startup
$ sudo docker run --env github.oauth2.client.clientId=xyz  --env github.oauth2.client.clientSecret=556542654721-it --rm -p 80:9090 cantara/sourcecodeportal
# Test the result
$ wget http://localhost/health
$ wget http://localhost/health/github
$ wget http://localhost/docs

# Copy a site-configuration to a running SCP docker image
# $ docker inspect -f   '{{.Id}}' cantara/sourcecodeportal
# d8e703d7e303
# $ docker inspect -f   '{{.Id}}' d8e703d7e303
# d8e703d7e3039a6df6d01bd7fb58d1882e592a85059eb16c4b83cf91847f88e5
# $ sudo cp config.json /var/lib/docker/aufs/mnt/**d8e703d7e3039a6df6d01bd7fb58d1882e592a85059eb16c4b83cf91847f88e5**/home/sourcecodeportal/config_override/conf/config.json

== Building and developing SourceCode Portal

You might want to take a look at the provided https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cantara/SourceCodePortal/master/Docker/Dockerfile[Dockerfile] to get installation details.

=== Pre-requisites

Requires JDK 11.

=== Some SourceCode Dashboard URLS when running from source on localhost

* http://localhost:9090/health [Health/status]
* http://localhost:9090/docs [SourceCode Documentation Portal site]
* http://localhost:9090/dump [Test of requests]


=== ChromeDriver

_ChromeDriver_ is required for obtaining GitHub access token.

An _OAuth2 App_ must be created for your organization on https://github.com/organizations/YOUR_ORGANIZATION/settings/applications. This is where you find your ClientId and ClientSecret.

An access-token must be generated before you can use this software. Please configure `security.properties` according to `security.properties.sample` and run the test case `ObtainGitHubAccessTokenTestTool`. Configure `security.properties` with `github.client.accessToken=ACCESS_TOKEN`.

[WARNING]
The `ObtainGitHubAccessTokenTestTool` doesn't work for Multi-Factor-Auth, in which prohibits use of `github.client.accessToken`. If access token is not configured; the client_id and client_secret will be applied on all GitHub requests. This is a workaround until oauth is handled by a website redirect scheme.

Ubuntu installation:

`apt-get install chromedriver`

MacOS installation:

`brew install chromedriver`

=== Generate GitHub Access Token using Docker

The ClientID and ClientSecret is found under you OAuth app: https://github.com/organizations/Cantara/settings/applications

`docker run -it -e SCP_github.oauth2.client.clientId=CLIENT_ID -e SCP_github.oauth2.client.clientSecret=CLIENT_SECRET cantara/sourcecodeportal /github-access-token`

Enter username, password and otp if you are using 2/mfa at GitHub.


=== ngrok (how to set up support for github hooks via a https proxy on developmnet/localhost)

[source,bash]
-----------------
# Open a terminal and change into the /opt directory.
$ cd /opt
# Use wget to download the ngrok application.
$ sudo wget https://bin.equinox.io/c/4VmDzA7iaHb/ngrok-stable-linux-amd64.zip
# Extract the downloaded file.
$ sudo unzip ngrok-stable-linux-amd64.zip
# Move the file into the /usr/local/bin directory to make it easily executable.
$ sudo mv ngrok /usr/local/bin
# Note the hex-id when you start ngrok
$ ngrok http 9090
# test that ngrok is happy
curl -I https://<hex-uid-from-running ngrok>.ngrok.io/ping
-----------------

* https://github.com/organizations/Cantara/settings/hooks/ [Set up/find github webhook]
** use https://<hex-uid-from-running ngrok>.ngrok.io/github/webhook
** select and set a secret  (same as _github.webhook.securityAccessToken_ in security.properties)
** Let me select individual events. select: Branch or tag creation, Pushes and Releases
** Upon save, you will see _POST /github/webhook           200 OK _ in the ngrok window
* Update github.webhook.securityAccessToken_ in security.properties with the secret value from the github webhook registration
* Do a commit/push and observe something like this in the scp log
** 21:21:53.054 [XNIO-1 task-1] TRACE n.c.docsite.controller.GithubWebhookController - Event -- xHubSignature: sha1=0fd0e22868e244102929297758fd35a -- xHubEvent: push -> Payload:
** ...
** 21:20:21.373 [XNIO-1 task-1] DEBUG n.c.docsite.controller.GithubWebhookController - GitHub WebHook is authorized..
** 21:20:21.373 [XNIO-1 task-1] DEBUG n.c.docsite.controller.GithubWebhookController - Received Push Event!

== Configuration

=== GitHub Webhook

The Source Code Portal is lisenting on push messages from GitHub.

== Build

Install NPM and Get Bootstrap and generate CSS using Sass:

`mvn mvn clean install -DskipTests`

> The build does not require any native pre-installation of this toolset. They are automatically set up by the maven plugins.

== Coding

SCP depends on `npm`, `node` and `sass` for the website. When you're working with ThymeLeaf templating you need those tools installed locally. There are few steps that is useful to reduce the amount server restarts.

`apt-get install nodejs` (requires 10.x+ and will also install npm for you)

`apt-get install sass` (requires 3.5+)

=== Setting up IntelliJ

Follow this step if you want to page template changes to to be syncronized with `target/classes/META-VIEW/views` folder:

* Keymap -> Main menu -> Build and assign a shortcut to Rebuild (on mac: cmd+shift+s)

To suppress JDK 11 warnings in IntelliJ when running `Server`, add VM option: `--illegal-access=deny`.

=== Sass watch

To detect changes to sass files and have the compiler produce new `target/classes/META-INF/views/css/app.css` file, either do:

* Use Sass Plugin (which doesn't require any native installation): `mvn com.github.warmuuh:libsass-maven-plugin:watch`. This is much slower than using the native sass command..

* Use  native Sass command: `sass --watch src/main/sass/scss:target/classes/META-INF/views/css`

> Now you should be able to tailor your pages on the fly and only restart the server when you do code changes that requires recompilation of the code base.

* Push CommitEvents arrives as single objects.
